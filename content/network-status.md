Heavy rain has been interrupting our Henry and Rivington connections downtown. This affects most nodes that are **not** directly connected to Supernode 1. We are planning a fix for this but it will take a few weeks to implement.

Saratoga Hub is still having bandwidth issues. We are about halfway through fixing this. There is now a fast connection from Soft Surplus to Saratoga. Next we have to upgrade the main router and also add a second West-facing sector antenna. This should all be completed over the next 4 weeks.

2019-7-13

3:45pm Fixed the problem (actually a bad port). Connection in Brooklyn should be faster now than it has been the past week.

2:40pm Replacing a bad cable. Brooklyn nodes may be down for 20 minutes or so.

2019-6-20

3:52pm Connection is back up. All nodes online

8:00pm The Rivington hub has disconnected causing outages downtown and at node 2090 in Greenpoint

9:38am The Saratoga hub gateway has been switched from Ehud to a 600 Mbps connection at Soft Surplus. This will improve bandwidth and latency for much of Brooklyn.

Brooklyn is experiencing slow speeds especially around 8 to 9pm ("Netflix time"). We are working on fixing this.

_Recently our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. We are still working on improving the new connections. The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._
